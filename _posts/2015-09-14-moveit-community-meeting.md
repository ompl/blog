Thank you for coming to the MoveIt! Community Meeting and thanks to the  presenters for making this a huge success. There were more than 240  people registered and more than 150 who attended from all over the  world. I apologize to those running Ubuntu who had issues joining us  (using Chrome was the suggested solution for the future).

MoveIt! now has a twitter account for updates: @moveitrobot
